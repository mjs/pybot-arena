# PyBot Arena

In this game, players implement an algorithm to control a tank in Python, and
then compete them against each other. A number of tanks can be active in a
single match at the same time.

The game borrows code and assets from
[PaulleDemon/Hunter2](https://github.com/PaulleDemon/Hunter2) but has been
heavily modified.
